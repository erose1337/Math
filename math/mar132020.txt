- Speech
    - The information (the words) are local in space and time
        - if you are there when someone says something, you do hear it
        - If you are there before/after someone says something, you do not hear it
        - if you're not there when someone says something, you do not hear it.
- Writing
    - (Space): The information exists locally (e.g. inside a book)
    - (Time): The information persists and exists in a given interval of time
        - The time between when the book exists and when it becomes indecipherable
        - Is local to that interval of time
- Internet
    - (Space): The information exists globally
    - (Time): The information persists and exists in a given interval of time
        - Arguably forever (e.g. archive.org)


On the time taken for information to move from the mind into the world
======================================================================
Organized by `information/second`:

- Chiseling into stone
- Writing by hand
- Typing (traditional keyboard)
- Speaking
    - Whether speaking is faster than typing depends on many factors
- Pictures
    - May take a very long time to produce
    - Receiving/parsing the information may be much faster
        - "A picture is worth a thousand words"

What comes next in the series?

- Typing (Non-traditional keyboard) (Chording keyboard?) ?
    - Completely re-design what a keyboard should be
    - Optimize keyboard layout and finger movement to maximize efficiency
- "Neural" brain-based interface?
    - Sounds sci-fi, but lots of work has already been done
    - Could make communicating images easier (and images carry lots of information)
