Information
===========
- (Input)
- A series of points
- A vector of numbers


Concept
=======
- (Data)
- A set of:
    - An Identifier
    - (Identifier, Concept/Information) tuples
    - Input port
        - On input:
            - read an (Identifier, Concept/Information) tuple from input port
            - set Concept[Identifier] = Concept/Information
    - Output port(s)
        - on output:
            - write an (Identifier, Concept/Information) tuple to output port


Inference
=========
- (Processing)
- A set of rules to be applied to a set of concepts
   - "Applied":
        - point rules output port to concepts input port
        - write (Identifier, Concept/Information) tuples to rules input port
        - collect output on port determined by rule

    Rule
    ----
    - (Instruction)
    - Concept where input identifier is associated with output Concept/Information
        - Mapping from sets of numbers to sets of numbers
    - Rules modify concepts while preserving correctness of relations between concepts
        - "relations" means some invariant
    - If a contradiction (broken invariant) is found, then some concept used in the process was False


Action
======
- (Output)
- Write a point to an output port
